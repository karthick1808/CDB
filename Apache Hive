Apache Hive 
CREATE TABLE employee(age int,gender string,name string,course string,roll int,marks int,email string) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',';
lod the data from HDFS Location
LOAD DATA INPATH '/input/StudentData.csv' INTO TABLE employee;
* hive will move the data to the default location
* if you drop the table the data will not be avaliable
lod the data from local location
LOAD DATA Local INPATH '/home/ubh01/Desktop/StudentData.csv' INTO TABLE employee;
* it wont move the data to the default location while loading
it will keep the local file system file as one local copy
 
Skip Header
CREATE TABLE employee(age int,gender string,name string,course string,roll int,marks int,email string) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' tblproperties("skip.header.line.count"="1");
LOAD DATA INPATH '/student/StudentData.csv' INTO TABLE employee;

Internal Table
CREATE TABLE employee(age int,gender string,name string,course string,roll int,marks int,email string) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' tblproperties("skip.header.line.count"="1");
LOAD DATA INPATH '/student/StudentData.csv' INTO TABLE employee;
External Table
CREATE external TABLE employee(age int,gender string,name string,course string,roll int,marks int,email string) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' tblproperties("skip.header.line.count"="1");
LOAD DATA INPATH '/student/StudentData.csv' INTO TABLE employee;

Partitioning
The partitioning in Hive means dividing the table into some parts based on the values of a particular column like date, course, city or country. The advantage of partitioning is that since the data is stored in slices, the query response time becomes faster.
2 types of partitioning 
Static Partition
Dynamic Partition

CREATE TABLE employee(age int,gender string,name string,course string,roll int,marks int,email string) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' tblproperties("skip.header.line.count"="1");
LOAD DATA INPATH '/student/StudentData.csv' INTO TABLE employee;

* partiting concept will not work with load command - you need to run the mapreduce job
* insert into method to load the data

Static Partition
# you should not mention the partition colum at the begining
CREATE TABLE staticemployee(age int,gender string,name string,roll int,marks int,email string) partitioned by (course string);
# while during the insertion you should not mention select * 
insert into table staticemployee partition (course='Cloud')  select age,gender,name,roll,marks,email from employee where course='Cloud';
